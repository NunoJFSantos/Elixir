# Elixir

Hackathon project developed in 24 hours on the final week of my fullstack developer bootcamp in <Academia de CÃ³digo_>

## The Project

This was a group project for the final challenge of this course. The idea was to develop a web application that facilitates the access of investors to innovative products in need of capital investment.
We build a RESTful web service in Java and a dynamic UI with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
